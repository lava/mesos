# Task State Reasons

Some TaskStatus messages will arrive with the `reason` field set to a value
that can allow frameworks to display better error messages and to implement
special behaviour for some of the reasons.

For most reasons, the `message` field of the TaskStatus message will
give a more detailed, human-readable error description.

Not every status update does carry a reason.


# Guidelines for Framework Implementers

A framework which implements its own executor is free to set the
reason field to the status messages it generates.

Note that executors can not generally rely on the fact that the
scheduler will see the status update with the reason set
by the executor, since the only the latest update
for each different task state is stored and re-transmitted.
See in particular the description of `REASON_RECONCILIATION` below.

Note that most reasons describe conditions that can only be detected in
the master or agent code, and will accompany automatically
generated status updates from either of these.

For consistency with the existing usages of the different task
reasons, we recommend that executors restrict themselves to the following
subset if they use a non-default reason in their status updates.

<table class="table table-striped">

<tr><td><code>     REASON_TASK_CHECK_STATUS_UPDATED
</code></td><td>   For executors that support running task checks, it is recommended
                   to generate a status update with this reason every time the task check
                   status changes, together with a human-readable description of the change
                   in the <code> message </code> field.
</td></tr>


<tr><td><code>     REASON_TASK_HEALTH_CHECK_STATUS_UPDATED`
</code></td><td>   For executors that support running task health checks, it is recommended
                   to generate a status update with this reason every time the health check
                   status changes, together with a human-readable description of the change
                   in the <code> message </code> field.
</td></tr>


<tr><td><code>     REASON_TASK_INVALID
</code></td><td>   For executors that implement their own task validation logic, this reason
                   can be used when the validation check fails, together with a human-readable
                   description of the failed check in the <code> message </code> field.
</td></tr>


<tr><td><code>     REASON_TASK_UNAUTHORIZED
</code></td><td>   For executors that implement their own authorization logic, this reason
                   can be used when authorization fails, together with a human-readable
                   description in the <code> message </code> field.
</td></tr></table>



# Reference of Reasons Currently Used in Mesos

## Deprecated Reasons

The reason `REASON_COMMAND_EXECUTOR_FAILED` is deprecated and will be removed
in the future. Please do not use it.


## Unused Reasons

The reasons `REASON_CONTAINER_LIMITATION`, `REASON_INVALID_FRAMEWORKID`,
`REASON_SLAVE_UNKNOWN` and `REASON_TASK_UNKNOWN` are currently not used
by Mesos.


## Reasons for Terminal Status Updates

For these status updates, the reason indicates *why* the task state changed.
Typically, a given reason will always appear together
with the same state.

Typically they are generated by mesos when an error occurs that prevents
the executor from sending its own status update messages.

Below, a partition-aware framework means a framework which has the
`Capability::PARTITION_AWARE` capability bit set in its FrameworkInfo.
Messages generated on the master will have the `source` field set to
`SOURCE_MASTER` and messages generated on the agent will have it set
to `SOURCE_SLAVE`.

As of Mesos 1.4, the following reasons are being used.


### For state `TASK_FAILED`
#### In status updates generated on the agent:

<table class="table table-striped">

<tr><td><code>     REASON_CONTAINER_LAUNCH_FAILED
</code></td><td>   The task could not be launched because its container failed to launch.
</td></tr>


<tr><td><code>     REASON_CONTAINER_LIMITATION_MEMORY
</code></td><td>   The container in which the task was running exceeded its memory allocation.
</td></tr>


<tr><td><code>     REASON_CONTAINER_LIMITATION_DISK
</code></td><td>   The container in which the task was running exceeded its memory allocation.
</td></tr>


<tr> <td><code>    REASON_IO_SWITCHBOARD_EXITED
</code></td><td>   The I/O switchboard server terminated unexpectedly.
</td></tr>


<tr><td><code>     REASON_EXECUTOR_REGISTRATION_TIMEOUT
</code></td><td>   The executor for this task didn't register with the agent within the allowed time limit.
</td></tr>


<tr><td><code>     REASON_EXECUTOR_REREGISTRATION_TIMEOUT
</code></td><td>   The executor for this task lost connection and didn't re-register within the allowed time limit.
</td></tr>


<tr><td><code>     REASON_EXECUTOR_TERMINATED
</code></td><td>   The tasks' executor terminated abnormally, and no more specific reason
                   could be determined.
</td></tr></table>



### For state `TASK_KILLED`
#### In status updates generated on the master:

<table class="table table-striped">

<tr><td><code>     REASON_FRAMEWORK_REMOVED
</code></td><td>   The framework to which this task belonged was removed.

<br/><strong>      Note:
</strong>          The status update will be sent out before the task is
                   actually killed.
</td></tr></table>



### For state `TASK_KILLED`
#### In status updates generated on the agent:

<table class="table table-striped">

<tr><td><code>     REASON_EXECUTOR_UNREGISTERED
</code></td><td>   The task was requested to be killed while the executor was still
                   registering.
</td></tr></table>



### For state `TASK_ERROR`
#### In status updates generated on the master:

<table class="table table-striped">

<tr><td>           The task was part of an accepted offer, but the slave
                   sending the offer disconnected in the meantime.
<br/><strong>      Note:
</strong>          For partition-aware frameworks, the state will be

</td></tr>


<tr><td><code>     REASON_MASTER_DISCONNECTED
</code></td><td>   The task was part of an accepted offer which couldn't be sent to the master, because it was disconnected.
<br/><strong>      Note:

<br/><strong>      Note:
</strong>          Despite the source being set to <code> SOURCE_MASTER </code>,
                   the message is not sent from the master but locally from the
                   scheduler driver.

### For state `TASK_LOST`
#### In status updates generated on the slave:

<table class="table table-striped">

<tr><td><code>     REASON_SLAVE_RESTARTED
</code></td><td>   The task was launched during an agent restart, and never got forwarded
                   to the executor.
<br/><strong>      Note:

                   the executor was started.
<br/><strong>      Note:

## Reasons for Non-Terminal Status Updates

These reasons do not cause a state change, and will be sent along with the
last known state of the task. The reason field indicates *why* the status
update was sent.


<table class="table table-striped">

<tr><td><code>     REASON_RECONCILIATION
</code></td><td>   A framework requested implicit or explicit reconciliation for this task.
<br/><strong>      Note
</strong>          Status updates with this reason are not the same status updates that were originally
                   but rather a modified copy that is re-sent from the master. In particular
                   the <code> data </code> and <code> message </code> fields are erased and the
                   original <code> reason </code> field is overwritten by <code> REASON_RECONCILIATION </code>.
</td>

<tr><td><code>     REASON_TASK_CHECK_STATUS_UPDATED
</code></td><td>   A task check notified the agent that its state changed.
<br/><strong>      Note:
</strong>          This reason is set by the executor, so for tasks that are running with a custom executor,
                   whether or not status updates with this reasons are sent depends on that executors implementation.
<strong>           Note:
</strong>          Currently, when using one of the built-in executors, this reason only be used with <code> TASK_RUNNING </code>
                   status updates.
</td></tr>


<tr><td><code>     REASON_TASK_HEALTH_CHECK_STATUS_UPDATED
</code></td><td>   A task health check notified the agent that its state changed.
<br/><strong>      Note:
</strong>          This reason is set by the executor, so for tasks that are running with a custom executor,
                   whether or not status updates with this reasons are sent depends on that executors implementation.
<strong>           Note:
</strong>          Currently, when using one of the built-in executors, this reason only be used with <code> TASK_RUNNING </code>
                   status updates.
